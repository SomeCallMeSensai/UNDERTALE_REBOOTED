	<br><br><br><br>
	QNA<br><br><br>
	
	1) Is this game a "reboot" of undertale, but done in your team's vision?<br><br>	
	A. No, UNDERTALE: REBOOTED is a completely new fangame INSPIRED by the idea of the communities' UNDERSWAP<br><br>
	
	2) Does this fangame change the way the characters feel?<br><br>
	A. NO! We do not want to change Toby's characters' personalities at all! Each character will be thrown new challenges that, well, challenge themselves in a way that expands on them.<br><br>
	
	3) When will this fangame release?!<br><br>
	A. We cannot sadly give you an answer. This project is our hobby and we will treat it as such. It takes time to produce this content so please be pacient!<br><br>
	
	4) Can I use your assests when the game releases?!<br><br>
	A. We'd personally like you not to, as we work hard to make these assest for this project. Any fan work is well excepted because we are a fanwork ourselves!<br><br>
	
	5) Can I join the team?<br><br>
	A. Personally, Sensational likes keeping his team small for consitency. He doesn't currently wish for any more help and is content with his team.<br><br>
	
	6) Is this fangame based off of UNDERTALE or DELTARUNE?<br><br>
	A. A bit of both! We were inspired by a web comic known as UNDERTALE:ALTERATION to combine the two concepts together for a unique spin on the formula.<br><br>
	
	7) Can I make videos of this fangame when it releases?<br><br>
	A. Yes, but simular to other fangames, we'd like to keep monitization out of the picture. We work hard on this as an appriciation to Toby with no value gained ourselves. So we ask you not to profit off of this too.<br><br>
	
	8) Didn't this used to be called SS!UNDERSWAP?<br><br>
	A. Yes! We decided to change the name to make our game more reconizable and free to do what we please, rather than following the swap formula.<br><br><br><br>
